WHY?

Yh you NEED to learn to do fast conversion. It matters when time is tight, and you're stuck deep in offsets, traces. (Real talk: From a live Security Review, hosted by Redacted Company — 2022 — where we were drowning in conversions while our opponent just kept running the track without a single hitch. and i believe this was also a reason for losing CTF ,point and of $$ .

If Skills Matches or is in ur level  but opp can do conv better  then 

Faster conversions → faster debugging → faster exploit → faster report → faster bounty. timing matters
